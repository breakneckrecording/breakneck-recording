    <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left;">

      <h3>1. No Shoes Inside the Studio</h3>
      <p>To maintain a clean and comfortable studio, all guests must remove their shoes upon entry. This helps protect the floors, carpets, and acoustic materials from outside dirt and debris. Feel free to bring a clean pair of shoes.</p>

      <h3>2. No Guns or Weapons</h3>
      <p>Weapons of any kind are not allowed in the studio—no exceptions. We prioritize the safety of everyone in the space.</p>

      <h3>3. No Food or Drink Near the Desk</h3>
      <p>Please keep all food and beverages away from the studio desk and equipment. Accidental spills can cause expensive damage to gear and disrupt sessions. A designated area is available for eating and drinking.</p>

      <h3>4. Studio Etiquette & Damage Responsibility</h3>
      <p>Please treat the studio as if it were your own. Keep the space clean and orderly. If you spill something or make a mess, please clean it up. Return things to their place when you’re done. Clients are financially responsible for any damage caused to studio property by themselves or their guests.</p>

      <h3>5. No Pets Allowed</h3>
      <p>No animals are permitted in the studio at any time. This is to protect our equipment, maintain cleanliness, and respect those who may have allergies or sensitivities.</p>

      <h3>6. No Recording of Unreleased Music Without Permission</h3>
      <p>Recording or playing unreleased tracks you don’t own or have explicit permission to use is not allowed. This protects all parties from potential copyright and legal issues.</p>

      <h3>7. No Negativity</h3>
      <p>We strive for a positive, creative atmosphere. Aggressive, toxic, or disrespectful behavior toward anyone in the session or studio staff will not be tolerated and may result in immediate termination of the session.</p>

      <h3>8. Collection of Session Files</h3>
      <p>If you need your session files, please collect them within 3 months.  Old session files will eventually be deleted to save space.</p>

      <h3>9. Respect Booking Times</h3>
      <p>Please arrive on time. Your session begins and ends at the scheduled time, regardless of arrival time.</p>

      <h3>10. Cancellations</h3>
      <p>Please provide at least 1 hour notice for cancellations. No-shows or late cancellations will be charged in full.</p>
